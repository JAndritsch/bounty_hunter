Bounty Hunter
=============

##Summary: 

Bounty Hunter is a World of Warcraft addon that  allows a player to place a 
bounty on another player's head after being ganked. 

##Features:

  * When a player dies from another player in World PvP, a dialog pops up to ask
  the user if they want to place a bounty on that player's head. If they do, they
  can supply an amount and a custom message.

  * To see current bounties, a player can open the bounties interface and get a
  list of the most recent bounties. The data will include things like:

    * The player's name who got killed
    * The name of the player who killed the other
    * How much gold the bounty is worth
    * The location of where the PvP event took place
    * A custom message posted by the player who created the bounty
    * The level and class of both characters

  * Players who want to take action against these bounties may choose to go after
  those that are on the board. When a vigilante player kills another who has a
  bounty, that bounty can be marked as "claimed", thus removing them from the
  bounties board. It is then up to that player to contact the poster of the bounty
  to claim the reward.
